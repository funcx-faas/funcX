# TODO: replace use of `typer` with `click` because
# 1. `typer` is a thin wrapper over `click` offering very minimal additional
#    functionality
# 2. `click` follows semver and releases new major versions when known
#    backwards-incompatible changes are introduced, making our application
#    safer to distribute

# disallow use of 22.3.0; the whl package on some platforms causes ZMQ issues
#
# NOTE: 22.3.0 introduced a patched version of libzmq.so to the wheel packaging
# which may be the source of the problems , the problem can be fixed by
# building from source, which may mean there's an issue in the packaged library
# further investigation may be needed if the issue persists in the next pyzmq
# release

# TODO: evaluate removal of the 'retry' library after the update to
# globus-sdk v3, which provides automatic retries on all API calls

# 'parsl' is a core requirement of the funcx-endpoint, essential to a range
# of different features and functions
# pin exact versions because it does not use semver
