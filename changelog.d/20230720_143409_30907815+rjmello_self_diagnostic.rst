New Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added a ``globus-compute-endpoint self-diagnostic`` command, which runs several
  diagnostic commands to help users and Globus Support troubleshoot issues.

  By default, all output prints to the terminal. The ``--gzip`` (or ``-z``) flag
  redirects the output to a Gzip-compressed file that the user can easily share
  with Globus Support.

  Endpoint log files can be quite large, so we cap the data taken from each file
  at 5,120 KB (5 MB). A user can modify this with the ``--log-kb`` option. For
  example, if a user wants to include 1,024 KB (1 MB) of data per log file, they
  would use ``--log-kb 1024``.
