Removed
^^^^^^^

- When submitting functions, it is no longer possible to specify a ``task_group_id``
  which does not already exist on the services. If this happens, the services will
  respond with an error.

  - Note that it is still possible to associate a task with an existing
    ``task_group_id``, with the correct authorization.

Changed
^^^^^^^

- Batches of tasks can now only be associated with a single endpoint. (Previously, tasks
  within a batch could be sent to heterogeneous endpoints.)

  - The signature of ``Client.create_batch`` has been adjusted to match.

- The return type of ``Client.batch_run`` has been updated to reflect the schema returned
  by the ``v3/submit`` route of the Compute API.

  - Concretely, ``Client.batch_run`` now returns a dictionary with information such as
    task group ID, submission ID, and a mapping of function IDs to lists of task IDs.
