Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^

 - The `HighThroughputExecutor` is now marked for deprecation.
   Importing and using this class will raise a warning.
   Upgrade to the `globus_compute_endpoint.engines.GlobusComputeEngine` which
   supercedes the `HighThroughputExecutor`.

   Please note that the `GlobusComputeEngine` has the following limitations:
   1. It binds to all network interfaces instead of binding to a single interface
      to limit incoming worker connections to the internal network.
   2. Does not support dynamically switching containers are runtime, and requires
      containers to be specified at the time the endpoint is started.
   3. Pending support for auto-scaling with `strategy`

   If the above limitations affect you, consider using `globus_compute_endpoint.engines.HighThroughputEngine`
   which is a designed to bridge backward compatibility issues.
