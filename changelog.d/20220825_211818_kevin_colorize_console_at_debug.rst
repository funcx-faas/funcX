New Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- funcX Endpoint: Implement ANSI escape codes ("color") for log lines emitted
  to the console.  This is currently targeted to aid the development and
  debugging process, so color is strictly to the console, not to logs.  Use
  the `--log-to-console` and `--debug` flags together.
