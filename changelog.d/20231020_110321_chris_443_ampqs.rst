New Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The ``Executor`` can now be told which port to use to listen to AMQP results, via
  either the ``amqp_port`` keyword argument or the ``amqp_port`` property.

- Endpoints can be configured to talk to RMQ over a different port via the ``amqp_port``
  configuration option.
