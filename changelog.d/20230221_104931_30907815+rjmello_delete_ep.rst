New Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Created `FuncxWebClient` and `FuncXClient` methods to delete endpoints
  from the web service.
- Added a `--force` flag for the `funcx-endpoint delete` command, which 
  ensures that the endpoint is deleted locally even if the web service
  returns an error or is unreachable.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- The `funcx-endpoint delete` command now deletes the endpoint both locally and 
  from the web service.
