New Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``GlobusComputeEngine`` can now be configured to automatically retry task failures when
  node failures (e.g nodes are lost due to batch job reaching walltime) occur. This option
  is set to 0 by default to avoid unintentional resource wastage from retrying tasks.
  Traceback history from all prior attempts is supplied if the last retry attempt fails.
  Here's a snippet from config.yaml:

.. code-block:: yaml

   engine:
      type: GlobusComputeEngine
      max_retries_on_system_failure: 2
