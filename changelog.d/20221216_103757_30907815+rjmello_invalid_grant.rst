New Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- When a `FuncXClient` is instantiated, the validity of the user's refresh
  tokens will be verified. If a token is found to be invalid, a new auth flow
  will be initiated.

- When an API auth error is raised by a `FuncXClient` method, a new auth flow
  will be initiated.
