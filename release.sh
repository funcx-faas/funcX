# Script to release a new version of the SDK and the Endpoint
#
# It does this by creating a tag named after the version, then running the
# tox release command for each package
#
# Requirements:
#   the version is set in globus_compute_sdk
#   the version is set in globus_compute_endpoint and matches globus_compute_sdk
#   the version number must appear to be in use in the changelog
#   you must have valid git config to create a signed tag (GPG key)
#   you must have pypi credentials available to twine (e.g. ~/.pypirc)
